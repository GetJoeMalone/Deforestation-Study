<h2>Report for ForestQuery into
 Global Deforestation, 1990 to 2016</h2>
<p>ForestQuery is on a mission to combat deforestation around the world and to raise awareness about this topic and its impact on the environment. The data analysis team at ForestQuery has obtained data from the World Bank that includes forest area and total land area by country and year from 1990 to 2016, as well as a table of countries and the regions to which they belong. </p>

<p>The data analysis team has used SQL to bring these tables together and to query them in an effort to find areas of concern as well as areas that present an opportunity to learn from successes. </p>

1. GLOBAL SITUATION 
According to the World Bank, the total forest area of the world was 41282694.90 square kilometers in 1990. As of 2016, the most recent year for which data was available, that number had fallen to 39958245.90 square kilometers, a loss of 1324449, or 3.21%. 
The forest area lost over this time period is slightly more than the entire land area of Peru  listed for the year 2016 (which is 1279999.99 square kilometers). 

2. REGIONAL OUTLOOK 
<p>In 2016, the percent of the total land area of the world designated as forest was 32.42%. The region with the highest relative forestation was Latin America & Caribbean, with 51.03%, and the region with the lowest relative forestation was Middle East & North Africa, with 2.07% forestation. </p>
<p>In 1990, the percent of the total land area of the world designated as forest was 82.88%. The region with the highest relative forestation was Latin America & Caribbean, with 51.03%, and the region with the lowest relative forestation was Middle East & North Africa, with 1.78% forestation. </p>

<p>The only regions of the world that decreased in percent forest area from 1990 to 2016 were Latin America & Caribbean (dropped from 51.03% to 46.16%) and Sub-Saharan Africa (30.65% to 28.72%). All other regions actually increased in forest area over this time period. However, the drop in forest area in the two aforementioned regions was so large, the percent forest area of the world decreased over this time period from 32.42% to 31.38%. </p>
<h3>3. COUNTRY-LEVEL DETAIL </h3>
<p>A. SUCCESS STORIES </p>
<p>There is one particularly bright spot in the data at the country level, China. This country actually increased in forest area from 1990 to 2016 by 527,229.06 square kilometers. It would be interesting to study what has changed in this country over this time to drive this figure in the data higher. The country with the next largest increase in forest area from 1990 to 2016 was the United States, but it only saw an increase of 79,200.00 square kilometers, much lower than the figure for China. 
China and the United States are of course very large countries in total land area, so when we look at the largest percent change in forest area from 1990 to 2016, we arenâ€™t surprised to find a much smaller country listed at the top. Iceland increased in forest area by 213.66% from 1990 to 2016.</p>
B. LARGEST CONCERNS 
<p>Which countries are seeing deforestation to the largest degree? We can answer this question in two ways. First, we can look at the absolute square kilometer decrease in forest area from 1990 to 2016. The following 3 countries had the largest decrease in forest area over the time period under consideration.</p>

<p>When we consider countries that decreased in forest area the most between 1990 and 2016, we find that four of the top 5 countries on the list are in the region of Sub-Saharan Africa. The countries are Togo, Nigeria, Uganda, and Mauritania. The 5th country on the list is Honduras, which is in the Latin America & Caribbean region.</p>  
<p>From the above analysis, we see that Nigeria is the only country that ranks in the top 5 both in terms of absolute square kilometer decrease in forest as well as percent decrease in forest area from 1990 to 2016. Therefore, this country has a significant opportunity ahead to stop the decline and hopefully spearhead remedial efforts. </p>
